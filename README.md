# Model-For-Assisting-Blind-People-By-Detecting-The-Surrounding-Objects-People-Activities-With-Voice-D
There have been several systems designed to support visually-impaired people and to improve the quality of their lives. Unfortunately, most of these systems are limited in their capabilities. We decided to build a model which detects all possible surrounding things and guide them through voice description. Our main objective is to detect the obstacles in the person's pathway and warn them using voice description.
